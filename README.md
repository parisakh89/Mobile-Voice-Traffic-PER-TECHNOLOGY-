# Mobile-Voice-Traffic-PER-TECHNOLOGY-
Transform telecom data into actionable insights. This Python toolset offers precise traffic analysis, vividly visualizing network distinctions. Stakeholders gain a comprehensive view of traffic distribution among VoLTE, 2G, and 3G networks, enabling strategic decision-making and resource allocation


Project Description:
Welcome to Mobile-Voice-Traffic-PER-TECHNOLOGY!
This repository hosts a collection of Python scripts designed to automate the extraction, analysis, and visualization of telecom network data for a daily report to stakeholders of a Mobile Operator .
Features:
•	Data Retrieval: Connects to Oracle databases to gather network performance metrics.
•	Analysis & Computation: Utilizes pandas, numpy, and cx_Oracle libraries to process and compute Erlang traffic, VoLTE percentages, and IMS subscriber statistics.
•	Visualization: Generates visual representations using matplotlib and seaborn for comprehensive data insights.
•	Reporting Automation: Daily report generation with charts and insights sent via email using Outlook integration.
Why Explore This Repository?
•	Automation: Simplify data extraction, analysis, and visualization processes for telecom network metrics.
•	Insights: Gain valuable insights into Erlang traffic distribution, VoLTE adoption rates, and IMS subscriber trends.
•	Convenience: Easily access scripts and tools designed to enhance telecom performance monitoring and time saving for daily reports and daily monitoring.
Technologies Used:
•	Python
•	cx_Oracle, pandas, numpy, openpyxl, matplotlib, seaborn
•	Oracle Database
•	Outlook integration for email reporting
